*vimp4python*	Perforce integration via P4Python API.

SEE THE COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE INFORMATION AT THE BOTTOM 
OF THIS HELP DOCUMENT.

This plugin provides a fairly comprehensive Perforce integration
to Vim.  Most basic commands that are useful when working on 
single files are supported.

The plugin was tested against:
    Vim 7.2,7.3
    Perforce 2009.2,2010.1
    Mac/Linux/Windows, in GUI and terminal

INSTALLATION:
Make sure you satisfy the requirements described below, then:
    Add vimp4python.vim to your Vim plugin directory.
    Add vimp4python.txt to your Vim doc directory.
    Start Vim and type :helptags <vim doc directory>.
    Get help by :help vimp4python.

REQUIREMENTS:
    P4Python API 
    Properly configured Perforce environment in the current
        working directory
    If you want to use P4RevGraph, you'll need Perl and the
        Graph::Easy module.

If Vim is not compiled with Python support, the plugin will 
not load.  On Windows, the version of Python that Vim is
built against must be available.

If Vim is not compiled with Perl support, or the Graph::Easy
module is not available, P4RevGraph will fail.

If the P4Python API is not available, the plugin will not
load.

If the current directory does not have a Perforce environment,
then the plugin will load, but most commands would generate
error messages.

NOTES:
Originally this plugin was going to be very limited in scope.
However, the ease of adding functionality via P4Python 
encouraged me to keep adding more Perforce commands.  So,
almost all Perforce commands are now available via the menu,
with the exception of a few administrative and special purpose
commands.

The commands most commonly useful while working with a single
file are made available via keyboard mappings.  Other commands
are available via the menu.

Rather than adding support for every option of every command,
I picked the options that would be most useful or appropriate
while working on single files.  For instance, running the
'P4Branches' command returns a list of branches owned by the
current user.  More generally, the P4Run command lets you enter
an arbitrary Perforce command.

This plugin is not a replacement for a full featured Perforce
client program.  If you need to do graphical merges or use 
time-lapse view, try out P4V.

The P4RevGraph function tries to build an ASCII-art revision
graph, showing only direct integration records.  It may be
useful in some circumstances, but a complex integration
history will almost certainly generate a diagram that is
difficult to read and understand.  Again, if you need a real
revision graph capability, try P4V.

The plugin tries to get information from Perforce about every
file being edited.  If your Perforce connection is slow, you
can disable the BufRead calls.

COMMANDS:
Call the method "PluginHelp" for a list of available commands.
